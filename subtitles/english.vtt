00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Reactions over reactions

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:08.000
Walking on the sky of my dreams

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:12.000
Come, come, my baby come, I will show you the world

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:17.500
Come, come, my baby come, I will cover your nightmares

00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:22.200
Come, come, my baby come, I will love you forever

00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:27.300
Come, come, my baby come, I will not let you go

00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:32.500
My love, I just feel so lost without you, boy

00:00:32.501 --> 00:00:41.000
I am yours even if time has passed — take me away from this impetuous world

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:46.000
Leaving this jail of my mind

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:51.000
Come, come, my baby come, I will show you the world

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:52.500
Come, come, my baby come, I will cover your nightmares
